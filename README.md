NeatoControl - control of the robot
==============

**Google Translate!**

Program management and diagnostic robot Neato XV-21.

Features are quite simple: to see the state of the sensors to change the schedule, set the time to get the image from the scanner.
(The program's interface leaves much to be desired - but there is room for improvement)

Use
-------------
Place the driver - by downloading the firmware update program (Neato Updater Tool) to [Off Site] (http://www.neatorobotics.com/support/software-update/step-one/).
Connect the robot to a computer, and then click Connect.

Known problems and their solutions
-------------------------------
If you are connected to the robot program, and then pulled out the USB cable is not clicking Disconnect.
The robot will not respond to any buttons - as is in the diagnosis of sensors and buttons (the so-called "TestMode"). Do not worry, this is normal.

Simply stop the program, connect the USB cable again, including the program, click Connect, and then Disconnect.

Denial of responsibility
------------------------
The program is provided "as is". The developer is not responsible for the use of the program (or not use).


Management
----------
Note: Be prepared to catch the robot! Before starting, make sure that the robot will not break anything and do not break the cord, do not pull off a laptop from the table, and so. In general promise to be careful (and as usual the responsibility lies with you).

If the USB cable from the connector will take off in the drive, the robot will execute the last command. For example will continue to go forward (destroying everything in its path). Just catch it and pick up in the air in seconds 5-10 team completed and it will stop.

Tab "Scanner" put a check "Manage".

Once press the button forward ** ** - robot went ahead. It will go forward until you press ** ** ago.

Pressing forward ** ** - increase speed.

** ** Left right - turns.

** ** Back - back.

All is almost obvious.

The management interface will be updated.
